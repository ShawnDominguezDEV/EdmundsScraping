# EdmundsScraping
A script to utilize in the Google Chrome Console to retrieve car review data from Edmunds.Com

This was to serve as a final assignment for a web development course at Texas State University.

The project was produced for Dr. Visinescu during Fall of 2019.

Purpose of the assignment was to make a script to scrape the data from a given website. My assigned website was "https://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/" requiring me to retrieve data about car reviews.

Obtaining this data through web scraping opens up many opportunites for data analysis. This data can be used in collaboration with software like R Studio to visualize and analyze trends in car reviews.
